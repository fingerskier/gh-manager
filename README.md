# gh-manager
Management dashboard for Github organization repositories

This is intended to be a desktop app that you can use to peruse your repos.
Token and org-name are [currently] stored in localStorage so it's securely suitable for anything other than localhost _at the moment_.

## Features

* Shows a list of repos [you have access to] in the given organization
* Shows a blurb for each of the selected repos
* Shows details on outstanding issues and action results for the selected repo
